<hr />

<h3>1. How to Train Your Dragon Movie Series</h3>
<p>I am a huge fan of this tetralogy, well partly to just because reasoningbut at the same time <br> 
    I was fascinated of the setting, the plot, the charaters and the overall lore of the world.</p>

<h3>2. Spiderman Multiverse Movie Series </h3>
<p>The way they set up the story, on how Miles Morales, and not another <br>
    Peter Parker as a new Spiderman was really refreshing,<br> 
    and the worldbuilding and lore on the second movie was interesting and mysterious as well.</p>

<h3>3. Rio</h3>
<p>I really like musicals in a movie without it overwhelming the overall flow of <br>
    of the movie and Rio, I think is one those movies that kept an overall blance between the music, the timing of when the 
    characters are supposed to sing and the theme of the movie as well. <br>The representation of Brazil was another bonus point as well.</p>
